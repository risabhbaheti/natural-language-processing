POS(Part of Speech) : Performed Part of Speech tagging for twitter data-set using Logistic regression and Conditional Random Field techniques. Token wise accuracy of 86.9% and sentence wise accuracy of 19.65% is achieved using CRF technique. 

Dependency Parser: Implemented the arc-standard algorithm to create dependecy trees similar to Nirve(2014) and then built a deep learning based dependency parser based on Mannning and Chen. I am able to achieve an accuracy of 84% on the dev-data set for Unlabelled attachment scores.
